Misc. notes in no particular order
----------------------------------

Rtfgen.java is a drop-in replacement for an older C++ program. 
That's why it comes with a CGI script instead of an applet page. 

During make, javac will complain about deprecated API. This is because 
System.setOut() (used to redirect standard output to a file) expects a 
deprecated class as parameter (IOW it's Sun's fault). 
Ignore the warning.

You'll need to install starlibj to run rtfgen.

Make sure GLOBALCLASSES directory (see Makefile) is in your CLASSPATH.

To run rtfgen.java interactively, type
    java EDU.bmrb.rtfgen.rtfgen input_file sort_option output_file
at command prompt.

 input_file   file that contains  chemical shifts. It must contain
              data loop of assigned chemical shifts in NMR-STAR 
	      format (it doesn't have to be a complete NMR-STAR
	      file).
 sort_option  1 -- "sort by amino-acid" actually prints sequences
                   in order they're listed in input file 
              2 -- sort by residue sequence code
 output_file  "-" (single dash without quotes) will output RTF to 
              the screen.
