Installing script files on BMRB webserver is simple:

 * Copy all files except globals.txt from project's src directory to
   $DocumentRoot/software/rtfgen on master website. Don't copy tmp/ subdir,
   create it in $DocumentRoot/software/rtfgen instead.
 * Make sure php_includes/Globals.inc file in $DocumentRoot has the settings
   in globals.txt.
 * Make sure there's sans.php (from sans project) in $SWLIBDIR.
 * Add all new files and directories to CVS.

Everything should be mirrored to public webservers automatically.
